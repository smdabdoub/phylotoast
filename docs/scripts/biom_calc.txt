biom_calc module
================

This module provides methods for calculating various metrics with regards to each OTU in an input OTU abundance table.

arcsine_sqrt_transform
----------------------
Takes the proportion data from relative_abundance() and applies the variance stabilizing arcsine square root transformation:

.. math:: X = sin^{-1} (\sqrt (p))

.. code-block:: bash

	usage: phylotoast.biom_calc.arcsine_sqrt_transform(rel_abd)

.. cmdoption:: rel_abd:

	Refers to a dictionary keyed on SampleIDs, and the values are dictionaries keyed on OTUID's and their values represent the relative abundance of that OTUID in that SampleID. rel_abd is the output of relative_abundance() function.

.. cmdoption:: return:

	Returns a dictionary keyed on SampleIDs, and the values are dictionaries keyed on OTUID's and their values represent the transformed relative abundance of that OTUID in that SampleID.

-----------------------------

mean_otu_pct_abundance
----------------------
Calculate the mean OTU abundance percentage.

.. code-block:: bash

	usage: phylotoast.biom_calc.mean_otu_pct_abundance(rel_abd, otuIDs)

.. cmdoption:: rel_abd:

	Refers to a dictionary keyed on SampleIDs, and the values are dictionaries keyed on OTUID's and their values represent the relative abundance of that OTUID in that SampleID. rel_abd is the output of relative_abundance() function.

.. cmdoption:: otuIDs:

	A list of OTUID's for which the percentage abundance needs to be measured.

.. cmdoption:: return:

	A dictionary of OTUID and their percent relative abundance as key/value pair.

-----------------------------

MRA
---
Calculate the mean relative abundance.

.. code-block:: bash

	usage: phylotoast.biom_calc.MRA(biomf)

.. cmdoption:: biomf:

	A BIOM file.

.. cmdoption:: return:

	A dictionary keyed on OTUID's and their mean relative abundance for a given number of sampleIDs.

-----------------------------

raw_abundance
-------------
Calculate the total number of sequences in each OTU or SampleID.

.. code-block:: bash

	usage: phylotoast.biom_calc.raw_abundance(biomf, sampleIDs=None, sample_abd=True)

.. cmdoption:: biomf:

	A BIOM file.

.. cmdoption:: sampleIDs:

	A list of column id's from BIOM format OTU table. By default, the list has been set to None.

.. cmdoption:: sample_abd:

	A boolean operator to provide output for OTUID's or SampleID's. By default, the output will be provided for SampleID's.

.. cmdoption:: return:

	Returns a dictionary keyed on either OTUID's or SampleIDs and their respective abundance as values.


-----------------------------

relative_abundance
------------------
Calculate the relative abundance of each OTUID in a Sample.

.. code-block:: bash

	usage: phylotoast.biom_calc.relative_abundance(biomf)

.. cmdoption:: biomf:

	A BIOM format.

.. cmdoption:: return:

	Returns a dictionary keyed on SampleIDs, and the values are dictionaries keyed on OTUID's and their values represent the relative abundance of that OTUID in that SampleID.

-----------------------------

transform_raw_abundance
-----------------------
Function to transform the total abundance calculation for each sample ID to another format based on user given transformation function.

.. code-block:: bash

	usage: phylotoast.biom_calc.transform_raw_abundance(biomf, fn=math.log10, sampleIDs=None, sample_abd=True)

.. cmdoption:: biomf:

	A BIOM file.

.. cmdoption:: fn:

	Mathematical function which is used to transform smax to another format. By default, the function has been given as base 10 logarithm.

.. cmdoption:: sampleIDs:

	A list of column id's from BIOM format OTU table. By default, the list has been set to None.

.. cmdoption:: sample_abd:

	A boolean operator to provide output for OTUID's or SampleID's. By default, the output will be provided for SampleID's.

.. cmdoption:: return:

	Returns a dictionary similar to output of raw_abundance function but with the abundance values modified by the mathematical operation. By default, the operation performed on the abundances is base 10 logarithm.
